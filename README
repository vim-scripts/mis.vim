This script provides syntax highlighting for the (rather obscure) MIS programming language.

It assumes the following conventions:

* names of pointers to address locations end in "_@".. Ex. mypointer_@
* names of pointers to pointers end in "_@@".. Ex. mypointer_@@

If these conventions are followed, the syntax will be highlighted accordingly.
